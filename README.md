### Requirements and built with üìãüõ†Ô∏è
* [Open JDK 11.02](https://jdk.java.net/archive/) 
* [Apache Netbeans IDE 14](https://netbeans.apache.org/front/main/download/nb14/) (The program can run on another version of the Apache Netbeans IDE, however, for greater compatibility we recommend version 14.) - _Development environment_
* Maven (Maven comes included with Apache Netbeans when it is installed, for this reason it is not necessary to do a particular installation.) - _Dependency manager_
* Java FX (This powerful library was used to build the graphical interfaces, the version used can be found in the file **pom.xml**.)
* [Scene Builder](https://gluonhq.com/products/scene-builder/#download) (The latest version of this program was used for compatibility with recent versions of JavaFX) - _We use Scene Builder to build graphical interfaces from a friendly environment._
_Note: It is important to review the **pom.xml** file of the project, because it contains the libraries used for the correct functioning of the program. It should be noted that libraries are added to obtain icons and elements such as buttons and view controls._
